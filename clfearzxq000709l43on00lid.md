[Overline Coin](http://bit.ly/3S04BC0) (OL) is the native cryptocurrency of the Overline network, a decentralized ecosystem that aims to create a metaverse of blockchain-based applications and services. In this post, we will explore what Overline Coin is, how it works within the Overline network, and how it differs from other cryptocurrencies.

**What is Overline Coin?**

[Overline Coin](http://bit.ly/3S04BC0) is a digital currency that was created to power the Overline network. It is a decentralized currency, meaning that it is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. Instead, it is based on a blockchain, which is a decentralized ledger that records all transactions on the network.

Overline Coin is designed to be used as a means of exchange within the Overline ecosystem. This means that users can use OL to pay for goods and services within the network. In addition, OL is used as a means of incentivizing users to participate in the network's governance and decision-making processes.

**How does Overline Coin work within the Overline network?**

The [Overline network](https://chainblock.hashnode.dev/how-to-earn-money-through-overline-network-metaverse-a-comprehensive-guide) is built on top of several existing blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot. This allows it to leverage the security and reliability of these established networks while offering its own unique features and functionalities.

One of the key features of the Overline network is its focus on interoperability. The network aims to enable [seamless communication](https://overline-metaverse.blogspot.com/2023/03/overline-metaverse-future-of-blockchain.html) and data transfer between different blockchains and networks, which is a major challenge in the current blockchain landscape. This interoperability is achieved through the use of Overline's custom-built cross-chain protocol, which allows different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other.

Another key feature of the Overline network is its focus on decentralized identity. The network aims to provide users with a secure and decentralized way of managing their identity across different applications and services. This is achieved through the use of Overline's custom-built identity protocol, which allows users to control their identity data and share it securely with other applications and services.

Within the Overline network, Overline Coin is used to pay for transactions and services. For example, users can use OL to pay for transaction fees when transferring funds or executing smart contracts on the network. In addition, OL can be used to pay for services offered by third-party developers within the network's ecosystem.

OL is also used as a means of incentivizing users to participate in the network's governance and decision-making processes. This is achieved through the use of the Overline Governance Token (OGT), a separate token that is used for governance and decision-making within the network. Holders of OGT can vote on proposals and influence the direction of the network's development. Incentives in the form of OL are offered to OGT holders who participate in the network's governance processes.

**How is Overline Coin different from other cryptocurrencies?**

Overline Coin differs from other cryptocurrencies in several ways. One key difference is its focus on interoperability and decentralized identity. While many cryptocurrencies focus solely on providing a means of exchange, the Overline network aims to provide a more comprehensive solution for decentralized applications and services.

Another key difference is the use of a dual token system. In addition to the native OL token, the network also uses the Overline Governance Token (OGT). This allows the network to separate the functions of governance and transactional use, and provides more flexibility and functionality within the network.

Finally, the use of the Overline network's custom-built cross-chain protocol allows for greater interoperability between different blockchain networks. This could potentially lead to greater adoption and usage of the Overline network and OL.
