## What are NFTs?

NFTs, short for non-fungible tokens, stand as exceptional digital assets meticulously recorded on the blockchain. Diverging from cryptocurrencies' fungibility, where each unit is replaceable, NFTs are non-fungible gems, each a distinct testament of ownership over a specific asset. The magic of NFTs unfolds through smart contracts—self-executing, code-based agreements. These ingenious contracts empower NFTs with tailored capabilities, including royalties, ownership privileges, and even the potential for progressive transformations.

## Types of NFTs

### Virtual Real Estate NFTs or Metaverse NFTs

[Virtual real estate NFTs](https://overline.network/?a=1BBtew97Qv9w) are digital plots of land that can be bought and sold on a blockchain. These NFTs are often used in blockchain-based virtual worlds, such as Overline Network or Decentraland Metaverse, where users can create and monetize their own virtual real estate.

## **oFriends**

Most people know ōFriends get 50% of the royalties ([more here](https://overline.network/?a=1BBtew97Qv9w)) in the upcoming land market. But you might not know that their owners can give rewards to the rest of our community!
