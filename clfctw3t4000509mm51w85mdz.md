In this post, we'll take a closer look at how the Referral Program works on the Overline Network Metaverse, and how you can get started with earning rewards.

What is the Referral Program?

The [Referral Program](http://bit.ly/3S04BC0) is a program that rewards users for inviting their friends to join the Overline Network Metaverse. When you refer a new user to the platform, you'll earn a percentage of the Overline tokens they earn through their activities on the platform. This is a great way to earn passive income, as you'll continue to earn rewards as long as your referrals remain active on the platform.

[How does it work?](http://bit.ly/3S04BC0)

To participate in the Referral Program, you'll need to [sign up](http://bit.ly/3S04BC0) for an account on the Overline Network Metaverse. Once you've created your account, you'll be given a unique referral link. You can share this link with your friends and followers on social media, email, or any other platform where you have a presence.

When someone clicks on your referral link and creates an account on the Overline Network Metaverse, they'll be added to your referral network. You'll earn a percentage of the Overline tokens they earn through their activities on the platform, including mining, staking, and participating in events and activities.

The percentage of rewards you'll earn varies depending on the activity and the user's level of participation. For example, you might earn a higher percentage of rewards for referring a user who becomes a high-level miner or staker, as they'll be earning more tokens overall.
