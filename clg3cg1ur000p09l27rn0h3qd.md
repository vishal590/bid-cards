1. 1. **Overline Network**: The [**Overline network**](https://chainblock.hashnode.dev/how-to-earn-money-through-overline-network-metaverse-a-comprehensive-guide) is built on top of several existing blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot. This allows it to leverage the security and reliability of these established networks while offering its own unique features and functionalities.
        
        One of the key features of the Overline network is its focus on interoperability. The network aims to enable [**seamless communication**](https://overline-metaverse.blogspot.com/2023/03/overline-metaverse-future-of-blockchain.html) and data transfer between different blockchains and networks, which is a major challenge in the current blockchain landscape. This interoperability is achieved through the use of Overline's custom-built cross-chain protocol, which allows different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other. Its interoperability is its unique feature. It's one of the top metaverse projects right now.
